h1. Open Source Flex?!

{{ page.date | date_to_string }} - {{ page.author }}

Apparently Adobe is <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Flex:Open_Source">planning on going open-source with the Flex framework</a>.

It seems this release will include not only the Flex Framework, but also the mxmlc compiler and debugger!

This is really exciting news, thanks to whoever made this call!
