{{ page.date | date_to_string }} - {{ page.author }}

It looks like the folks over at MSN  <a href="http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/Investing/HomeMortgageSavings/shower.aspx">agree that SWF really is the best way to get video content in front of the most users</a>!

Maybe this is just a switch for those of us on Mac?
