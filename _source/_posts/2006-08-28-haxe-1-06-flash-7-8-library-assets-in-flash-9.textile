h1. HaXe 1.06 :: Flash 7/8 Library Assets in Flash 9

{{ page.date | date_to_string }} - {{ page.author }}

Before I've even had a chance to experiment with "haXe 1.05":http://www.asserttrue.com/articles/2006/08/17/haxe-1-05-with-flash-player-9-support, verison "1.06":http://www.haxe.org/download has been released!  How long did that take?  Maybe a week?  Two of the more interesting features of this version are that it supports the use of "Flash 7/8 library assets from Flash 9 code":http://haxe.org/tutos/flash9#using_the_library and there's been an addition of a "RubyGems":http://www.rubygems.org/ like distribution system called "haxelib":http://haxe.org/haxelib.

You can read about all of the new features and "Nicolas' blog":http://ncannasse.free.fr/?p=74, but here's a quick glance at the change log:

* allowed extern enums
* use only matching construct when parameters are matched
* fixed bug preventing & char to be sent between JS and Flash remoting
* improved flash9 api (more strict)
* flash9 xml : use JS ReXml parser
* added neko.io package (Input/Output)
* moved neko.File and neko.Socket to neko.io package
* fixed flash optional arguments (when extending flash.MC)
* fixed neko native serialization problems
* variable modification does not have side effects in 'for x in a...b'
* jit disabled by default for neko web server
* enable flash7-8 libraries usage from flash9
* unknown identifier become "class not found" when is a classpath
* changed haxe.PosInfos handling
* added -debug (removed --flash-debug) on flash9 and neko only now
* added Type.typeof
* improved Serializer speed
* added Serialization support for Date, Hash, IntHash, List
* added flash9 and JS IE/Opera class reflection
* added haxe.xml.Check and haxe.xml.Fast
