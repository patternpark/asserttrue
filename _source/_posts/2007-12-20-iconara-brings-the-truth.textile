h1. Iconara Brings the Truth

{{ page.date | date_to_string }} - {{ page.author }}

In the spirit of always running late to the party, I just discovered a  blog today that other folks have probably been following since '06.

"This guy":http://blog.iconara.net articulates many of my gripes, moans and complaints in a way that is definitely helpful. If you're building large applications with ActionScript 3 (or Flex for that matter), he can provide some insight into why things just aren't working the way you may have expected them to.
