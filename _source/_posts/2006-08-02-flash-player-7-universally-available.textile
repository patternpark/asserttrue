h1. Flash Player 7 === Universally Available

{{ page.date | date_to_string }} - {{ page.author }}

To make the most universally available application  today (multiplatform / cross-platfrom / cross-software / cross-hardware) that runs on "win":http://www.windows.com/Passion/index_enu.html, "mac":http://www.apple.com/macosx/, and "nix":http://www.kernel.org/ desktops; multiple palmtops; and all modern browsers, you need to publish to the Flash Player 7.  That's right, the SWF format that's two versions old.

The most recent mobile phone player, "Flash Lite 2.0":http://www.adobe.com/products/flashlite/, "is based on the Flash Player 7":http://www.adobe.com/products/flashlite/productinfo/features/#item-1, so by targeting Flash Player 7 you can develop for phones.  Flash Player 7 also "runs on Pocket PCs":http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer_pocketpc/ and "is the most recent version of the player for Linux":http://weblogs.macromedia.com/emmy/archives/2005/12/why_isnt_there.cfm, so you also get Pocket PC and Linux support by deploying to it.

If you're interested in developing a code-base that'll be able to run in as many environments as possible, write that code-base in a language that will compile to Flash Player 7 bytecode.  Languages to choose from today are "ActionScript 2.0":http://tech.motion-twin.com/mtasc.html, "C#":http://www.globfx.com/products/neoswiff/, "XAML":http://www.xamlon.com/software/xamlonpro/flash/, "RVML":http://www.kinesissoftware.com/products/index.php, and "haXe":http://www.haxe.org.

Have fun building the future today!
